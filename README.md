# Welcome to the **Legends of CranFlakes Star Wars Server!**

**On October 27th(Friday) to October 29th(Sunday)CranFlakes will be hosting a JvS old school rule type event. This means that there are 3 teams based off of gear provided in the Star Wars mod.**
1. Team 1 Jedi
2. Team 2 Mandalorians
3. Team 3 Sith

CranFlakes will no longer be running its original rule-set of (FFA with duel zones) There will still be duel zones if you don't wish to participate in the faction wars. Below you can find the full gear sheet we will be going off of for teams. Please follow these to stay in line with our rule-set.

Teams go based off of the color of the lightsaber/weapon you are using. If you are not using a lightsaber/weapon displayed on the gear sheet and using a blaster instead then the teams are based off of the helmet piece you have equipped.

If you are having issues understanding the gear sheet and rule set for this event do not hesitate to ask one of our staff members for assistance!

Duel room rules will still apply during this event.
